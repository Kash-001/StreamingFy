# StreamingFy

i've tried to make a spotify bot, that worked for 4 days then stopped making streams, so either spotify updated to new bot catch script, either i've ran into an alreadry madae anti bot script.

So i'm giving up on it, with a bit of knowledge you can make it work again.

**features :
- beginning of proxy work with
- event logs
- automation from A to Z
- easy customizable script since i made a modules folder

**todo :
- finish proxy script (really easy)
- add multithreading (harder)
- bypass the actual problem
